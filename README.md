## About ðŸ‘‹

Hi, Iâ€™m Abilio Almeida Eiroa, but most people just call me Bili.

Iâ€™m a Software Product Engineer with over 10 years of experience developing products and services, primarily using web technologies across both backend and frontend. Iâ€™ve also built hybrid mobile apps, cross-platform desktop applications, and small web-based games.

Iâ€™m also a hacker at heartâ€”passionate about technology and always curious to explore its boundaries from a learning perspective.

I have a degree in Computer Engineering and a masterâ€™s in Computer Security.

Throughout my career, Iâ€™ve worked across various companies and sectors, primarily in startups (my own as well as othersâ€™) and scaleups, in roles ranging from development to leadership.

To keep it brief, Iâ€™ll just say that Iâ€™m committed to fostering an inclusive work environment while helping the team achieve company goals by advising and empowering others. Iâ€™m also dedicated to promoting and upholding best practices in development for strong product maintenance. I enjoy working collaboratively to solve end-to-end challenges.
